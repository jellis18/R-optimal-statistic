# R optimal statistic

Contained in this repository are several functions for creating the matrix auxiliaries needed for computing the OS, as well as the OS function itself. The data used here is that from the [IPTA mock data challenge](http://www.ipta4gw.org/?page_id=126) (we use open dataset 3). While these data do not have many of the complexities of real data it affords a good testing ground.
